# Project 2: Gated Entry System
Abigail Michalek and Ashley Pontillo
Febuary, 16 2023

The purpose of this project was to introduce a new feature to the smart house system that opens and closes a password protected gate. 

The user is able to enter a passcode via a matrix keyboard with instructions given on a LCD display. When the correct passcode is entered, the gate will open, allowing the user to pass, and closes after they have passed through.

If the user entered an incorrect passcode, the gate remains locked. The user has three tries to enter the correct passcode before the gate entry feature is disabled.

Note about Demonstation Video:

In our demostation video, it was not directly captured on the video that the gate opened however you can hear the noise of the gate opening and see that it closed. It was hard to capture both the display on the LCD as well as the gate opening since both happen simultaneously.
